define even as lambda takes x, if x mod 2 equals 0, then true, otherwise false.

define odd as
    lambda takes x
        if x mod 2 equals 0
            then return false
        otherwise return true

define length as lambda takes sequence, if sequence is null, then return 0
                                        otherwise return add 1 length rest sequence


define reverse as
    lambda takes sequence
        if sequence is null then return empty
        otherwise return construct last sequence reverse rest sequence

define guessing-game takes number-to-guess as
       define guess as input from standard-in
              if guess is less than number-to-guess
                  then print "too low"
                  and call guessing-game with random-int
              otherwise if guessing-game is greater than number-to-guess
                  then print "too high"
                  and call guessing-game with number-to-guess
              otherwise print "correct"
